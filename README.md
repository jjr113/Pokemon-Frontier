## Concept
Pokémon fangame inspired by classic titles like Pokémon Fire Red and Leaf Green. Redesigning locations, emulating new storylines, and other aspects of the classic games are all part of this varied approach.
## Experience Goals and Motivation
Experience goals for creating a Pokemon fan-made game can include:

1. Learning game development skills: Developing a fan-made game requires various game development skills, such as programming, game design, art, and sound. Creating a fan-made game can help developers improve their skills in these areas.

2. Creating something unique: Creating a fan-made game allows developers to create something unique that hasn't been seen before in the Pokemon universe. This can provide a sense of creative fulfillment and satisfaction.

3. Sharing their passion for Pokemon: Many developers create fan-made games because they are passionate about the Pokemon franchise and want to share that passion with others.

Motivations for creating a Pokemon fan-made game can include:

1. Love for the Pokemon franchise: Many developers create fan-made games because they love the Pokemon franchise and want to create something that reflects that love.

2. Frustration with the official games: Some developers may be frustrated with certain aspects of the official Pokemon games and create fan-made games to address those issues.

3. Desire to innovate: Fan-made games can allow developers to experiment with new ideas and mechanics that may not be present in the official games.
## Background and History
The basic idea behind the Pokémon franchise is that players take on the role of a Pokémon trainer in a fictional world filled with various creatures known as Pokémon. The goal is to capture and train these creatures, building a strong team of Pokémon that can be used to battle against other trainers and their Pokémon.
<br><br>
Players explore the world, visiting towns and cities, battling other trainers, and collecting new Pokémon. Along the way, they may encounter challenges and obstacles that they must overcome in order to progress in the game.
<br><br>
The gameplay mechanics of Pokémon games typically involve turn-based battles between the player's Pokémon and their opponents. Each Pokémon has its own unique set of stats and abilities, and players must strategically choose which Pokémon to use in battle and which moves to use in order to defeat their opponents.
<br><br>
As players progress through the game, they may earn badges by defeating gym leaders, powerful trainers who specialize in specific types of Pokémon. These badges signify the player's progress and can be used to gain access to new areas of the game.
<br><br>
Ultimately, the goal of the game is to become the strongest Pokémon trainer in the world, by collecting as many Pokémon as possible, defeating other trainers and gym leaders, and eventually challenging the Elite Four, a group of powerful trainers who serve as the final bosses of the game.
